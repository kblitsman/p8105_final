# Importing Data

```{r import}
saes = read_sas("./state_saes_final.sas7bdat") %>%
  clean_names()
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
