# Importing Data

```{r import}
saes = read_sas("./state_saes_final.sas7bdat") %>%
  clean_names() %>% 
  filter(pyear > 4 & pyear != 12 & area == 2) %>% 
  select(outname, pyearnm, area, stname, pyear, agegrp, est_total, nsel, ncomp, pop)
```

## Including Plots

```{r plots, echo=FALSE}
saes %>% 
    filter(outname == "nonmedical use of pain relievers in the past year" & agegrp == 0 & stname == "Colorado") %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = pyearnm, y = est_total)) +
    geom_point() +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5))

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
