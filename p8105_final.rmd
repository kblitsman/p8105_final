# Importing Data

```{r import}
saes = read_sas("./state_saes_final.sas7bdat") %>%
  clean_names() %>% 
  filter(pyear > 5) %>% 
  select(outname, pyearnm, area, stname, pyear, agegrp, est_total, nsel, ncomp, pop)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
